    Database
================

Note that you have PostgreSQL 9.4.5 running via the Postgres.app (in Applications).

    - Here's the command to create the [CARKY_DB_NAME] database:
    
        createdb [CARKY_DB_NAME]
    
    - Here's how you connected to this database as a superuser via pgAdmin3:
    
        + Add a server with the following properties:
        
            Name: [any friendly name of your choosing]
            Host: localhost
            Username: [your Mac OS X username]
            Password: [your Mac OS X password]
    
    - With the connection established, here's how you can create a table:
    
        > [connection name]
        
            > [database name]
            
                > Schemas
                
                    > public
                    
                        Tables // right-click, then click 'New Table'
    
    - Once you have a table created, you can create indexes as follows:
    
        > [connection name]
                
            > [database name]
            
                > Schemas
                
                    > public
                    
                        > Tables
                        
                            > [table name]
                            
                                Indexes // right-click, then click 'New Index'
    
    - For the various commands used to create the carky.net tables, refer to pgAdmin3
    
        
    
    - Here's the command to create the [CARKY_DB_USERNAME] user:
    
        CREATE USER [CARKY_DB_USERNAME] WITH PASSWORD [CARKY_DB_PASSWORD]
    
    - To login from a command prompt:
    
        psql -d [CARKY_DB_NAME] -U [CARKY_DB_USERNAME]
    
    - TODO and WYLO .... Here's the command to grant permissions to [CARKY_DB_USERNAME] on the ? table:
    
        GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,  ON ? TO [CARKY_DB_USERNAME]
    
    - The 'users' table looks like this:
    
        +------+---------+------------+--------+--------+
        |  id  |  email  |  password  |  code  |  name  |
        +------+---------+------------+--------+--------+
