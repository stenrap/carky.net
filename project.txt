    - Implement your design for the 'Create Account' form (and use some Greensock to transition to it)...
    - Get account creation fully working (with a 'token' column in the users table, and an email)
    - Come up with a design for the 'Help' form on the login page
    - Add jQuery validation to all the login forms
    - Get the 'Remember Me' functionality working
    - Set up Hibernate the way you did in usana (of course using DBCP instead of C3P0)
